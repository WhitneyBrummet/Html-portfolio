<h1>The Best Movies According to Whitney</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>How To Train Your Dragon</h3>
<p>A story about vikings taming and riding dragons. This is my favorite movie because
    I watched it with my mom on our day out alone together in IMAX 3D. I also like 
    the compelling story of someone who doesn't fit in to normal society finding their
    own path.

<h3>Bolt</h3>
<p>You can't go wrong with Disney and you definitely can't go wrong with a dog with 
    superpowers. I like the way this movie shows the bond between a dog and human.</p>
<h3>Spirit</h3>
<p>Favorite childhood movie.</p>
